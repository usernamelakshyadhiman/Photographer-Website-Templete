            A photographer is someone who is skilled at taking pictures or
            photographs with a camera. An amateur photographer takes pictures
            for their own use. A professional photographer takes pictures as all
            or part of their job. Many people hire a photographer for their
            wedding, debutante party or other special events. Photographers work
            in many different specialties. A news photographer can take
            photographs quickly when events are rapidly changing. They act as
            the "eyes" for their publications. Their job is to take as many
            photographs as they can so an editor can later select the best ones
            for the story. They correct photos with software, add captions, and
            send them to their editors. Many news photographers also shoot rapid
            sequences of film as short videos. An aerial photographer is
            comfortable around airplanes and is skilled at taking high and low
            altitude pictures. They work with specialized cameras which can take
            infrared, three-dimensional, black and white and color aerial
            photographs. A still life photographer takes pictures of still life
            or inanimate objects. This can be for advertising, art or science.
            The subjects may be food, products, or nature studies. Still life
            photographers must know how to use lighting, angles and have other
            skills to make an object look as good in movies as it does in real
            life. A fashion photographer takes pictures of clothing, makeup,
            hair designs and other similar products. They shoot pictures of
            models. In addition to fashion, they may specialize in areas such as
            the music industry or movies.
